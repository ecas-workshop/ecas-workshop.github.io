## Scope

Recent technological and scientific trends are promoting a vision where intelligence is more and more distributed and collective. Indeed, as computing and communication technologies are becoming increasingly pervasive, and complexity of systems is growing in terms of scale, heterogeneity, and interaction, hence the focus tends to shift from the intelligence of individual devices or agents to the collective intelligence emerging from a dynamic collection of diverse devices. Such intelligence would allow systems to address complex problems through proper coordination (e.g., cooperation or competition), to self-organise to promote functionality under changing environments, and to improve decision-making capabilities.  
The workshop aims to provide a forum where researchers and practitioners can share and discuss fundamental concepts, models, and techniques for studying and implementing collectively intelligent distributed systems. Accordingly, it welcomes original research work providing ideas and technical contributions for promoting scientific discussion and practical adoption of collective intelligence mechanisms in engineered systems.

The topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Algorithms for self-adaptive/self-organizing system behaviour
- Algorithms of artificial collective intelligence (e.g., multi-agent reinforcement learning)
- Techniques for task-specific collective intelligence
- Extraction of collective knowledge in Internet of Things systems
- Collaborations of humans and artificial agents in socio-technical systems
- Formal models for computational collective intelligence
- Design and verification of emergent properties in distributed systems
- Coordination models and languages
- Programming languages for distributed CI systems
- Languages for multi-tier programming or macro-programming
- CI for distributed wearable computing systems
- Techniques for crowd computing systems and applications
- Applications of distributed CI for smart environments
